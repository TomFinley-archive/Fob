<!-- <H2>Fob Overview</H2> -->

<P>Fob is a free dock-based kitchen timer for Mac OS X by Leaky Puppy Software.  It allows a user to specify possibly multiple timers to count down for a specified interval.  When an alarm runs out of time, Fob will make itself conspicuous.</P>

<P>(Fob is not an alarm clock or stopwatch, i.e., it will not count to a particular time, nor count up.)</P>

<P>The presence of presets is Fob's main gimmick for decreasing the effort required to start an alarm.  To draw an analogy to web browsers, they are a kind of time bookmark for commonly used alarms.  For example, I may define a six minute preset to let tea steep.  Thence, I need only choose "Tea" from my preset list, and I never need deal with a neglected lukewarm cup in my microwave again.  Starting a preset alarm requires only one mouse click rather than many clicks and typing.</P>

<P>Fob thus appeals to the unspeakably lazy and undisciplined.  Needless to say I will make several million dollars.</P>

<!-- <P>In the pre-digital age, a clock making itself conspicuous often involved a buzzing or ringing sound; today's space-age technology has allowed the human race &mdash; to my doubters, I continue to maintain I am a part of the human race &mdash; to progress the term "ring" to mean more than the repeated striking of a hammer on a bell.  What a wonderous world we live in!</P> -->

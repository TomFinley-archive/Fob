<P>This section describes the customization available through the preferences.</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Confirm Deletions</B></DT>
<DD>If on, when deleting an alarm or preset, a dialog will pop up to confirm the delete.  If not selected, the alarm or preset will be deleted with no fanfare.</DD>

<DT><B>Fob Visible in Background</B></DT>
<DD>This controls whether Fob will display itself when it is inactive.  Note that if Fob is set to hide itself in the background, it will hide only the larger window.  The abbreviated window will not automatically hide itself in either case.</DD>

<DT><B>Menu Bar Display of Alarm</B></DT>
<DD>If on, there will be a widget in the menu bar that displays the alarm with the least time left.  This is unavailable in pre-Jaguar OS X.</DD>

<DT><B>Show Alarm Name</B></DT>
<DD>If on, the name and time of the alarm with least time will be displayed in the menu bar when displaying the alarm in the menu bar.  If off, only the time will be displayed.</DD>

<DT><B>Scale Dock Time Display</B></DT>
<DD>If on, the time display in the dock icon will be scaled to take up all available horizontal space.  If off, the time display in the dock icon will remain constant.</DD>

<DT><B>Deactivate Cmd-Q for Quit</B></DT>
<DD>If you run Fob in the background, you may not wish for it to be so easy to quit accidentally.  This setting tells Fob to not respond to command-Q.  You can still quit Fob via the application menu or the dock menu as usual.</DD>

<DT><B>Dock Alarms in Submenus</B></DT>
<DD>If on, Fob will display alarms in submenus of its dock menu.  If off, the alarms are displayed in the top level of the dock menu.  This allows you to reduce dock menu clutter if you have many alarms.</DD>

<DT><B>Clear Due Alarms on Quit</B></DT>
<DD>If on, all alarms that are due at the time you quit Fob shall be deleted.</DD>

<DT><B>Alarm Feedback</B></DT>
<DD>This controls how annoying Fob will become when an alarm runs out of time.  There are three levels.  The lowest level will make the dock icon flash.  The middle level will make the dock icon flash and there will be one beep when the alarm runs out.  The highest level will make the dock icon flash, and every time the dock icon flashes (every two seconds) there will be a beep.</DD>

<DT><B>Bouncing Icon</B></DT>
<DD>This allows the user to control if the dock icon will actually bounce when an alarm runs out of time.  There are three levels.  The lowest means no bounces.  The middle level will make the dock icon bounce <EM>once</EM> alarm runs out.  The highest level will make the dock icon bounce continuously until either Fob is brought to the forefront or the alarm is deleted (as by the "clear due" method in the dock menu).  Note that if Fob is the currently active application when an alarm runs out the icon will not bounce.  This feature is unavailable in pre-Jaguar OS X.</DD>

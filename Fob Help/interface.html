<H2>Interface</H2>

<P>The left of the Fob window is where the user defines a new alarm.  A clock dominates the interface.  A user may define a time by dragging about the hands of this clock.  Below the clock the user may manually type in the hours, minutes, and seconds, as well as a description for the alarm.</P>

<P>The right of the Fob window shows the preset alarms, and the current alarms.  The presence of presets is Fob's gimmick for decreasing the effort required to start an alarm.  To draw an analogy to web browsers, they are a kind of time bookmark for commonly used alarms.  The current alarms, displayed on the bottom, are alarms that are currently counting down (or have finished); Fob allows an arbitrary number of alarms.</P>

<P>The top of the Fob window contains the toolbar.  The actions the user may perform with this are covered in the <A HREF="doingstuff.html">Doing Stuff</A> section.</P>

<P>Fob's dock icon is important.  The icon will be the normal Fob icon if there is no current alarm.  Otherwise, Fob will display the currently active alarm.  If there are multiple current alarms, Fob will display the most recent alarm.  The alarm is displayed as a countdown timer, <EM>unless</EM> the alarm is out of time, in which case the icon will flash between a bright and dull version.</P>

<P>Note that if Fob has been quit or is otherwise not currently active, when an alarm runs out of time it will not notify the user; the user will be notified the next time the program starts up.  Thus, Fob is meant to be run in the background.</P>

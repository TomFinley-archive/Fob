<H2>Dock</H2>

<P>Aside from displaying the status of the alarm with the least time left as described in the <A HREF="interface.html">interface</A> section, it is possible to exercise some limited control of Fob from the dock, including starting presets, looking at the current alarms, and clearing due alarms.</P>

<P>To use the dock interface, right click, control click, or click and hold on the Fob dock icon.  The <B>Clear Due</B> action is the same as in the toolbar, i.e., current alarms that have run out of time are deleted.  The <B>Preset Alarms</B> submenu will list Fob's preset alarms; choosing one will start that preset alarm.  The <B>Current Alarms</B> submenu will display the currently active alarms.</P>

<P>Unfortunately due to restrictions, one cannot have live update in dock menus, so the displayed time remaining for currently alarms will be at the point where the user brought up the dock menu.  If anyone knows a way around this, write me!</P>

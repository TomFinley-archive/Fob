<H2>Dock</H2>

<P>Aside from displaying the status of the alarm with the least time left as described in the <A HREF="interface.html">interface</A> section, it is possible to exercise some limited control of Fob from the dock, including starting presets, looking at the current alarms, and clearing due alarms.</P>

<P>To use the dock interface, right click, control click, or click and hold on the Fob dock icon.  The <B>Text Alarm</B> and <B>Clear Due</B> actions are the same as in the toolbar, i.e., the ability to start an alarm from input text, or that current alarms that have run out of time are deleted.  The <B>Rewind Last Due</B> item will rewind the latest alarm to become due.</P>

<P>Below these actions, the menu will also show preset alarm, and current alarms.  Choosing a preset alarm will start that preset alarm.  Choosing a current alarm will pause the alarm if it is running, or start the alarm if it is paused.  It is also possible to put these alarms in <B>Preset Alarms</B> and <B>Current Alarms</B> submenus in the <A HREF="preferences.html">preferences</A>.</P>

<P>Unfortunately due to restrictions in Cocoa and OS X itself, one cannot have live update in dock menus.  So, the displayed time remaining for currently alarms will be at the point where the user brought up the dock menu.  If anyone knows a way around this, write me!</P>

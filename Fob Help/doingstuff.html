<H2>Doing Stuff</H2>

<P>This section describes what the user may do, and the results of those actions, and alternate methods of accomplishing these actions if not obvious.</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Start / Set New Alarm</B></DT>
<DD>The alarm currently displayed in the clock will be started, displaying it in the current alarm table.</DD>

<DT><B>Text Alarm / Set Alarm From Text</B></DT>
<DD>This allows the user to define an alarm textually with nothing but the keyboard.  The syntax for this text as well as several examples are provided <A HREF="textual.html">here</A>.  The action currently displayed in the Fob main window will perform when the alarm runs out of the time.</P></DD>

<DT><B>Store / Add As Preset</B></DT>
<DD>The alarm currently displayed in the clock will be stored as a preset alarm.</DD>

<DT><B>Start Selected / Start Selected Presets</B></DT>
<DD>This starts the selected alarms of the preset table.  The user may also start a preset alarm by double clicking its row in the preset table, or by selecting it from the dock menu.</DD>

<DT><B>Delete</B></DT>
<DD>The item currently selected will be deleted, whether it be an alarm or any other item.  Hitting the delete key accomplishes the same effect.</DD>

<DT><B>Removed Selected Alarms / Removed Selected Presets</B></DT>
<DD>Those alarms selected in current alarms (or presets, for "Remove Selected Presets") will be deleted.</DD>

<DT><B>Clear Due / Clear Due Alarms</B></DT>
<DD>Any alarm that has run out of time will be deleted.  This is also available from the dock menu.</DD>

<DT><B>Rewind / Rewind Selected/Last Due Alarm</B></DT>
<DD>Takes any selected active alarms, and "rewinds" them so that they have the time that they originally started with.  If no alarm is selected, Fob rewinds the non-deleted alarm that most recently ran out of time.  If no alarm is selected and no alarm is due, nothing happens.  One may also select <B>Rewind Last Due</B> from the dock menu to rewind the non-deleted alarm that most recently ran out of time.</DD>

<DT><B>Pause / Pause Selected Alarms</B></DT>
<DD>Selected active (currently running) alarms will be paused.  You can alternatively double-click an active alarm, or select it from the dock menu.</DD>

<DT><B>Unpause / Unpause Selected Alarms</B></DT>
<DD>Reactivate the selected paused alarms.  You can alternatively double-click a paused alarm, or select it from the dock menu.</DD>

<DT><B>Preferences</B></DT>
<DD>This allows the user to edit <A HREF="preferences.html">preferences</A>.</DD>
